   <h1>The Internet Code, simplified</h1>
   <p>The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has created the <a href="/eng/archive/2019/2019-269.htm">Internet Code</a> (or the Code) so that customers of retail fixed Internet access services (Internet services) are better informed of their rights and responsibilities contained in their contracts with Internet service providers (service&nbsp;providers).</p>
   <h2>Objectives</h2>
   <p>The Internet Code will</p>
   <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
    <li>make it easier for individual customers to obtain and understand the information in their Internet service contracts;</li>
    <li>establish consumer-friendly business practices for the Internet service industry where necessary;</li>
    <li>contribute to a dynamic Internet service market; and</li>
    <li>further the policy objectives out in paragraphs 7(a), (b), (f), and (h) of the <em>Telecommunications Act</em>.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Application</h2>
   <p>The Code applies to large facilities-based Internet service providers, namely:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Bell Canada (including Bell MTS, NorthernTel and Télébec)</li>
    <li>Cogeco</li>
    <li>Eastlink</li>
    <li>Northwestel</li>
    <li>RCCI</li>
    <li>SaskTel</li>
    <li>Shaw</li>
    <li>TCI</li>
    <li>Videotron</li>
    <li>Xplornet</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The Code applies to all Internet services provided to individual customers by large facilities-based Internet service providers, in all provinces and territories, regardless of the status and business models of the service provider, whether purchased on a stand-alone basis or as part of a bundle, and whether purchased in person, online, or over the phone. All service providers to which the Code applies must comply with the Code.</p>
   <p><em>Note: The <a href="/eng/archive/2017/2017-200.htm">Wireless Code</a>, as set out in Telecom Regulatory Policy <a href="/eng/archive/2017/2017-200.htm">2017-200</a>, applies to mobile wireless data services.</em></p>
   <h2>Definitions</h2>
   <p><a href="#def">Definitions of key terms are provided at the end of the Code.</a></p>
   <h2>Implementation date</h2>
   <p>The Internet Code comes into effect&nbsp;on <strong>31 January 2020</strong>.</p>
   <h2>Implementation for new, renewed, amended, and existing contracts</h2>
   <p>The Internet Code applies in full to new, renewed, and amended contracts. It also applies to existing contracts, excluding provisions B.1., B.2., B.5., C.1., F.2., G.1., and G.2.</p>
   <h2>Administration</h2>
   <p>A customer who believes that their service provider is not adhering to the Code must first try to resolve the problem directly with the service provider. If the customer is not satisfied with the service provider’s response, they can contact the Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services Inc. (CCTS) as follows:</p>

   <h2>Preamble</h2>
   <h3>1. Interpretation</h3>
   <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
    <li>In interpreting the Code: 
     <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
      <li>if any part of the Code or a contract for Internet services is ambiguous, or if it is unclear how the terms of the Code or the contract are to be applied, then the Code and the contract must be interpreted in a manner that is favourable to the customer;</li>
      <li>a service provider may not require a customer to waive a right under the Code, contractually or otherwise, in order to receive the service provider’s services; and</li>
      <li>the Code and its provisions are to be interpreted purposively, by reference to their objectives.</li>
     </ol></li>
    <li>The CCTS may interpret the Code for the purpose of investigating complaints. Decisions rendered by the CCTS about specific complaints cannot be appealed to the CRTC. If, however, at any time service providers or other interested persons are unclear about the application or interpretation of the Code by the CCTS, they may seek guidance or interpretation from the CRTC through Part 1 applications. The CRTC reserves the right to issue guidelines of general application.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>2. Retaining evidence</h3>
   <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
    <li>A service provider must retain any information necessary to defend an allegation of a breach of the Internet Code.</li>

      <li>A service provider’s offer must include all key contract terms.</li>
      <li>A service provider must retain information demonstrating that all key contract terms were disclosed at the time of an offer. A service provider must provide this information to customers and to the CCTS upon request at no charge.</li>

     <h3>1. Provision of contract</h3>
     <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
      <li>When a contract is agreed to, a service provider must give the customer a contract that meets all the conditions regarding the content of the contract as set out in provision B.5. A terms of service document is sufficient to meet this requirement only if it contains all of the information required by provision B.5.</li>
      <li>A service provider must give the customer a&nbsp;permanent copy&nbsp;of the contract and related documents, in the format of the customer’s choosing (electronic or paper) and at no charge, in the following circumstances:

         <ol>
          <li>where the customer chooses to receive a paper copy of the contract, send the contract and related documents to the customer within 15 calendar days of the customer agreeing to the contract; or</li>
          <li>where the customer chooses to receive the contract electronically, send the contract and related documents to the customer no later than one business day after the contract was entered into.</li>

     <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
      <li>If a service provider fails to provide the contract within the required time frame, or if the terms and conditions of the permanent copy of the contract conflict with the terms and conditions that the customer agreed to, the customer may, within 45&nbsp;calendar days of the start of the contract, cancel the contract without paying an&nbsp;early cancellation fee&nbsp;or any other penalty.</li>
     </ol>
     <h3>3. When a customer requests a copy of their contract</h3>

     <h3>1. Early cancellation fees – General</h3>
     <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
      <li>If a customer cancels a contract before the end of the commitment period, the service provider must not charge the customer any fee or penalty other than the early cancellation fee. This fee must be calculated in the manner set out below.</li>
      <li>When a subsidized device is provided as part of the contract, 
       <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
        <li>for fixed-term contracts, 
         <ul>
          <li>the early cancellation fee must not exceed the value of the device subsidy; and</li>
          <li>the early cancellation fee must be reduced by an equal amount each month, such that the early cancellation fee is reduced to $0 by the end of the lesser of 24 months or the total number of months in the contract term.</li>
         </ul></li>
        <li>for indeterminate contracts,

          <li>the early cancellation fee must not exceed the value of the device subsidy; and</li>
          <li>the early cancellation fee must be reduced by an equal amount each month, over a maximum of 24 months, such that the early cancellation fee is reduced to $0 by the end of that period.</li>
         </ul></li>
       </ol></li>
      <li>When a subsidized device is not provided as part of the contract, 
       <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
        <li>for fixed-term contracts: the early cancellation fee must be set out in the contract and may be charged only for the lesser of 24 months or the total number of months in the contract term. The early cancellation fee must be reduced to $0 by the end of that period.</li>
        <li>for indeterminate contracts: a service provider must not charge an early cancellation fee.</li>

      <li>When calculating the early cancellation fee, 
       <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
        <li>the value of the device subsidy is the retail price of the device minus the amount that the customer paid for the device when the contract was agreed to;</li>
        <li>the retail price of the device is the lesser of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price or the price set for the device when it is purchased from the service provider without a contract; and</li>
        <li>a month that has partially elapsed at the time of cancellation is considered a month that has completely elapsed.</li>
       </ol></li>
     </ol>
     <h3>2. Trial period</h3>
     <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
      <li>When a new customer agrees to a contract through which they are subject to an early cancellation fee, a service provider must offer the customer a trial period lasting a minimum of 15 calendar days to enable the customer to determine whether the service meets their needs.</li>
      <li>If a customer self-identifies as a person with a disability, the service provider must offer an extended trial period lasting a minimum of 30 calendar days to enable the customer to determine whether the service meets their needs.</li>
      <li>The trial period must start on the date on which service begins.</li>
      <li>The usage limits for the standard trial period must correspond to half the permitted monthly usage specified in the customer’s contract, whether the contract includes limited or unlimited monthly use. For customers with disabilities, the permitted usage amounts must be at least double the service provider’s usage limits for the standard trial period.</li>
      <li>During the trial period, customers may cancel their contract without penalty or early cancellation fees if they have 
       <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
        <li>used less than the permitted usage; and</li>
        <li>returned any equipment or device provided by the service provider, in near-new condition, including original packaging, if applicable.</li>

     </ol>
     <h3>3. Cancellation date</h3>
     <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
      <li>A customer may cancel their contract at any time by notifying their service provider.</li>
      <li>A service provider must cancel service on the day requested by the customer or by another party acting on behalf of the customer.</li>
     </ol>
     <h3>4. Refunds for prepaid services not provided following cancellation</h3>
     <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
      <li>A service provider must not charge for a service that is not, and cannot be, provided following cancellation.</li>
      <li>All service providers must provide refunds for Internet services following cancellation of such services when some or all of the monthly service fees are billed in advance. The refunds must be pro-rated, based on the number of days left in the last monthly billing cycle after cancellation.</li>
     </ol>
     <h3>5. Contract extension</h3>
     <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
      <li>To ensure that customers are not disconnected at the end of the commitment period, a service provider may extend a contract, with the same rates, terms, and conditions, on a month-to-month basis.</li>
      <li>A service provider must notify a customer on a fixed-term contract, at least 90&nbsp;calendar days before the end of their initial commitment period, whether or not the contract will be automatically extended. This notification must include 
       <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
        <li>the date on which the contract is set to expire;</li>
        <li>a statement informing the customer that as of that date, they can switch plans, change service providers, or cancel their service without penalty; and</li>
        <li>information explaining 
         <ol>
          <li>whether the contract will be automatically extended with the same rates, terms, and conditions, on a month-to-month basis; and</li>
          <li>if the contract is not being automatically extended, the proposed new minimum monthly charge for service going forward.</li>

      <li>If the grounds for disconnecting a customer are failure to pay, a service provider can disconnect a customer’s postpaid service only if the customer 
       <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">

        <li>agreed to a deferred payment plan with the service provider and fails to comply with the terms of this plan.</li>
       </ol></li>
      <li>A service provider cannot disconnect a customer’s service on the grounds of failure to pay if the customer has paid a security deposit and the security deposit covers the past due amount.</li>
      <li>Except with customer consent or in other exceptional circumstances, disconnection may occur only on weekdays between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. or on weekends between 9&nbsp;a.m. and 5 p.m., unless the weekday or weekend day precedes a statutory holiday, in which case disconnection may not occur after noon.

     <h3>2. Notice before disconnection</h3>

       <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
        <li>action is necessary to protect the network from harm;</li>
