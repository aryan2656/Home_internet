   <h1 id="wb-cont" property="name">The Wireless Code, simplified</h1>
   <p>The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has created this Wireless Code (the Code) so that consumers of retail mobile wireless voice and data services (wireless services) will be better informed of their rights and obligations contained in their contracts with wireless service providers (service providers).</p>
   <p>The Wireless Code will</p>
   <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
    <li>make it easier for individual and small business customers to obtain and understand the information in their wireless service contracts;</li>
    <li>establish consumer-friendly business practices for the wireless service industry where necessary; and</li>
    <li>contribute to a more dynamic wireless market.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>The Code applies to all wireless services, whether purchased on a stand-alone basis or as part of a bundle, and whether purchased in person, online, or over the phone. All service providers must comply with the Code. All sections of the Code apply to postpaid services. The following sections of the Code also apply to prepaid services: A.1-3; B.2; E.1, E.4, and E.5; F.1-4; G.1-4; and J.1.</p>
   <p><a href="#def">Definitions of terms used in the Code</a>, including the differences between prepaid services and postpaid services, are provided at the end of the Code. Defined terms are indicated in&nbsp;<strong><em>italics and bold</em></strong>&nbsp;the first time they appear in the Code.</p>
   <p>A customer who believes that their service provider is not adhering to the Code must first try to resolve the problem directly with the service provider. If the customer is not satisfied with the service provider’s response, they can contact the Commissioner for Complaints for Telecommunications Services Inc. (CCTS) as follows:</p>

   <h2>Preamble</h2>
   <h3>1. Interpretation</h3>
   <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
    <li>In interpreting the Code: 
     <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
      <li>If any part of the Code or a <strong><em>contract</em></strong> for wireless services is ambiguous, or if it is unclear how the terms of the Code or the contract are to be applied, then the Code and the contract must be interpreted in a manner that is favourable to the <strong><em>customer</em></strong>;</li>
      <li>A <strong><em>service provider</em></strong> may not require a customer to waive a right under the Code, contractually or otherwise, in order to receive the service provider’s services; and</li>
      <li>The Code and its provisions are to be interpreted purposively, by reference to their objectives. In order to understand the objectives of the Code and any specific provision of the Code, reference shall be made to <a href="/eng/archive/2013/2013-271.htm">Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2013-271</a> and <a href="/eng/archive/2017/2017-200.htm">Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC&nbsp;2017-200</a>.</li>

     <h3>4. Trial period</h3>
     <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
      <li>When a customer agrees to a contract through which they are subject to an early cancellation fee, a service provider must offer the customer a trial period lasting a minimum of 15 calendar days to enable the customer to determine whether the service meets their needs.</li>
      <li>The trial period must start on the date on which service begins.</li>

       </ol></li>
      <li>If a customer self-identifies as a person with a disability, the service provider must offer an extended trial period lasting a minimum of 30 calendar days, and the permitted usage amounts must be at least double the service provider’s general usage amounts for the standard trial period.</li>
      <li>During the trial period, customers may cancel their contract without penalty or early cancellation fee if they have

        <li>used less than the permitted usage; and</li>
        <li>returned any device provided by the service provider, in near-new condition, including original packaging.</li>

     <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
      <li>Customers may cancel their contract at any time by notifying their service provider.</li>
      <li>Cancellation takes effect on the day that the service provider receives notice of the cancellation.</li>
     </ol>
     <h3>6. Contract extension</h3>
     <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
      <li>To ensure that customers are not disconnected at the end of the commitment period, a service provider may extend a contract, with the same rates, terms and conditions, on a month-to-month basis.</li>
      <li>A service provider must notify a customer on a fixed-term contract at least 90 calendar days before the end of their initial commitment period whether or not the contract will be automatically extended. This notification must include 
       <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
        <li>the date on which the contract is set to expire;</li>
        <li>a statement informing the customer that as of that date, they can switch plans, change services providers, or cancel their service without penalty; and</li>
        <li>information explaining 
         <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
          <li>whether the contract will be automatically extended with the same rates, terms, and conditions, on a month-to-month basis; and</li>
          <li>if the contract is not being automatically extended, the proposed new minimum monthly charge for service going forward;</li>
         </ol></li>
       </ol></li>
      <li>At the time that a service provider offers a customer a device upgrade, the service provider must clearly explain to the customer any changes to the existing contract terms caused by accepting the new device, including any extension to the commitment period.</li>
